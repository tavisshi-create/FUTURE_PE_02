# 🌐 Task 2: AI-Powered Portfolio Website
Built as part of the **AI Prompt Engineering Internship** at **Future Interns**.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project involved designing and deploying a fully functional, responsive portfolio website using **Lovable AI** (a prompt-to-app generator). The goal was to showcase how natural language prompts can be engineered to build a high-quality web interface with custom styling and interactive components.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Design & Dev:** Lovable AI (Prompt-to-Code)
- **Framework:** React / Vite (Generated)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Lovable Live Preview / GitHub Pages

## ✨ Key AI Features Implemented
- **AI-Driven UI:** Engineered specific prompts to create a dark-themed, futuristic tech aesthetic.
- **Smart Content Generation:** Used LLMs to write professional project descriptions and service offerings.
- **Responsive Layout:** Ensured the AI-generated code is mobile-friendly and optimized for different screen sizes.
- **Project Showcase:** Integrated assets from Task 1 (Thumbnail & Video) into a dedicated portfolio section.
